# Offline Contact Manager

Introducing an Offline contact manager using Hono-Deno and no major JS frameworks.

It is a simple contact manager that allows you to manage your contacts offline.

Reason for using Deno is its secure by default approach. It also allows you to **compile the code into a executable(.exe)** which can be used on other machines without even having to install additional dependencies or even Deno itself.
